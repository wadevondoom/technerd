Enemy AI Strategies:

Tank Enemy:
- Uses a finite state machine to define the different states of the enemy, such as idle, attacking, and reloading.
- Fires powerful projectiles that deal high damage but have a slow rate of fire.

Fast Enemy Car:
- Uses a behavior tree to define the behavior of the enemy, such as moving towards the player, ramming the player, and fleeing if the player is too close.
- Moves quickly and has low health, but deals high damage with its ramming attack.

Boss Enemy:
- Uses a state machine to define the different phases of the enemy, such as a defensive phase, an offensive phase, and a vulnerable phase.
- Has multiple attacks and movements that change depending on the current phase of the boss.

Code Snippets:

// Tank Enemy State Machine
var tankEnemyStateMachine = new StateMachine({
    init: 'idle',
    transitions: [
        { name: 'attack', from: 'idle', to: 'attacking' },
        { name: 'reload', from: 'attacking', to: 'reloading' },
        { name: 'idle', from: ['attacking', 'reloading'], to: 'idle' }
    ],
    methods: {
        onAttack: function() {
            // Code to attack the player
        },
        onReload: function() {
            // Code to reload the tank's weapon
        },
        onIdle: function() {
            // Code to do nothing
        }
    }
});

// Fast Enemy Car Behavior Tree
var fastEnemyCarBehaviorTree = new BehaviorTree({
    root: new SelectorNode({
        nodes: [
            new SequenceNode({
                nodes: [
                    new MoveTowardsPlayerNode(),
                    new RamPlayerNode()
                ]
            }),
            new FleePlayerNode()
        ]
    })
});

// Boss Enemy State Machine
var bossEnemyStateMachine = new StateMachine({
    init: 'defensive',
    transitions: [
        { name: 'offensive', from: 'defensive', to: 'offensive' },
        { name: 'vulnerable', from: 'offensive', to: 'vulnerable' },
        { name: 'defensive', from: ['offensive', 'vulnerable'], to: 'defensive' }
    ],
    methods: {
        onOffensive: function() {
            // Code to switch to the offensive phase
        },
        onVulnerable: function() {
            // Code to switch to the vulnerable phase
        },
        onDefensive: function() {
            // Code to switch to the defensive phase
        }
    }
});
